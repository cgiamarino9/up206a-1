# Week 1 (10/5): Introduction to Spatial Data Science


## Lecture
###   Overview of the course
*   Expectations
*   Introductions
*   Mid-term and final projects will be based on groups (pairings)
*   Where did ArcMap go?
*   Questions?
###   What is Urban Data Science?
*   How is it relevant to planning?
*   What makes this course unique?

### Groups
*   Next week we will create our groups! If you must drop the course, please do so before the next class... There is also a long wait list!

## Hands on
*   Introducing GitHub
*   Introducing JupyterHub
    * log into our class JupyterHub
    * when you are in the classic notebook interface, click New, Terminal. This should open a new tab with a terminal window.
    * clone the class repo by typing `git clone https://github.com/yohman/up206a.git`
    * go back to the main notebook tab. You should see a new folder `up206a`
    * navigate to Weeks, Week 1, and open the first Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb)
    
*   Intro to Python

## Individual Assignments
### Create a GitHub account, and start a new repo

*   Create a GitHub account, and create a project repo named “up206a-yourfirstname” - [Instructions](https://github.com/yohman/up206a/blob/master/Git%20related/02%20-%20Create%20your%20class%20repo.md)
*   Create a Readme.md file in your GitHub class repo, and introduce your Data Science project space (hint: use this [markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))

### Data search
*   Search for two or more potential data sources that you may use. Make sure that they are "downloadable." Then, write a sentence or two for each dataset that explains how it can be used to answer a potential research question, and how you think it can be visualized spatially.

## Reading assignment
This week's reading assignment is for you to find an article, blog, journal, chapter, or book that talks about data/information/knowledge/coding that includes some spatial component. Make sure it is something that you would like to share with the class. Then, write a paragraph (yes, a paragraph, not two) that summarizes the article. Write a second paragraph where you reflect critically and creatively about the material in your own words. Why did this article speak to you in regards to your approach to data and research? 

The instructors will select a few of the readings for discussion in week 2.
